# ChronoInvestigation Project

## Description

The ChronoInvestigation project is aimed at developing a Python tool that facilitates visual investigative scenarios, akin to the VIS tool by OCCRP. Our tool goes a step further by allowing users to create, visualize, and link timelines, promoting a detailed chronological visualization of events and how they interconnect.

## Features

### Implemented

- **Visual Timeline Creator**: Allows users to create individual timelines delineating a series of events in a chronological order.
- **Timeline Linking**: Enables users to link events from different timelines, creating a network of interconnected events that can help in visualizing the broader picture.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can interact with the visualizations, gaining insights into the individual events and their connections through a user-friendly interface.

### In Progress

- **Collaborative Timelines**: Functionality that will allow multiple users to collaborate on a single timeline, adding and editing events collectively.
- **Integration with External Data Sources**: We are working to enable the tool to integrate and fetch data from external sources to facilitate real-time updates to the timelines.

### Planned

- **Advanced Search and Filter**: Users will be able to search and filter events based on various criteria to quickly find the information they are looking for.
- **Reporting Feature**: A feature that will allow users to generate reports from the timelines, facilitating the sharing and presentation of findings.

## Progress Report

As of our latest update, we have successfully developed the core functionalities of the ChronoInvestigation tool, including the visual timeline creator and timeline linking feature. The interactive visualization interface is in a functional state, allowing users to work with the basic version of the tool.

We are in the process of implementing collaborative timelines and integration with external data sources, aiming to provide a more enriched user experience in the upcoming versions.
