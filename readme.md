### Public News Choice Tool

# Overview
The "Public News Choice Tool" is a web application developed with the Python Flask framework, envisioned to be a comprehensive platform where users can not only manage detailed profiles of individuals but also create intricate timelines related to those individuals, echoing functionalities seen in the revered VIS tool. This project sets a new standard in documenting and visualizing intricate relationships and events spanning over various timelines.

## Features
Individual Profiles: Allows users to create, update, and manage detailed profiles encompassing not only basic details but also nuanced attributes, facilitating a deeper understanding and detailed tracking of individuals.
Timeline Creation and Linking: Users will have the ability to create timelines delineating significant events in an individual’s life or a specific series of events. These timelines can be interlinked, providing a comprehensive view and understanding of how different events and individual lives interconnect.
Article Attachments: A unique feature where users can attach articles and other pieces of information to specific events, individuals, or timelines, allowing for a rich, detailed source of information and references directly linked to the events or individuals they pertain to.

## Upcoming Features
Visual Timeline Representation: The heart of this project lies in its ambitious aim to offer a visual representation of timelines, where users can visually traverse through different events, understand the chronological relationships between them, and delve into the intricate web of interconnected events and individuals.
Event and Action Recording: Users will be encouraged to add detailed events and actions to individual timelines, fostering a detailed narrative that encapsulates the multifaceted nature of real-world events and personal narratives.

## Future Endeavors
As we forge ahead, we aim to introduce more functionalities, including but not limited to:

Rich Media Integration: Enhancements to allow users to integrate rich media such as videos, images, and podcasts to timelines, ensuring a multimedia-rich narrative.
Collaborative Features: Facilities for collaborative timeline creation, where multiple users can co-create and manage timelines, fostering a collaborative environment.
Machine Learning Integration: Leveraging machine learning algorithms to provide intelligent insights and analytics derived from the extensive data collected through the platform.

## Development Timeline
Phase 1 (Current): Laying down the foundation with basic people management and API endpoint setup.
Phase 2: Introduction of the timeline creation and management feature with basic visualization capabilities.
Phase 3: Integration of article attachment functionalities and initial deployment of visual representation features for the timelines.
Phase 4: Further enhancements including rich media integration and collaborative features, aiming for a robust, multimedia-rich platform.
